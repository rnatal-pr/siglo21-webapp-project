Project SigloXXI: Website that will provide several templates to offer services. Some of the services I have been thinking about are the following: creating informative websites for a business, personal blog for an influencer or a ecommerce site for entrepeneurs, giving them the necessary tools to compete with bigger business and launch their dream project. Basically, this will be the first website done of the SigloXXI series. 

Personal Objective: Implement the idea of SigloXXI and start making React.js websites with more condfidence. 

Technology: Responsive React.js website, it will use styled components, react smooth scroll, react hooks and react router.
